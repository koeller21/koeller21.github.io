                <p>
                    I recently stumbled upon an issue as I was building a web-service for a start-up company one of my pals founded.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We had to create this sign-up html form for school students where they would enter their school's name so we could 
                    later match them with vacation courses taking place at their school. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    One could argue that there are conceptually simpler ways of matching students with nearby courses as a student 
                    could just get a list of all future courses taking place and then look for their respective school at sign-up. 
                    However, we 
                    wanted to persist a many-to-one relationship between students and schools in the database for multiple reasons.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For consistency reasons, we also decided we wanted to allow the students only choose
                    from a pre-selected list of schools, i.e. no free-text-form for the school's name at sign-up should be allowed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This, of course, poses the challenge of having a complete, somewhat homogenous and up-to-date list of all schools 
                    in Germany.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Naturally, that complete list of Germany's schools does not exist. It does not exist not because Germany authorities lack
                    the innovative mindset or skills to provide such a list but because 
                    Germany's education system is decentralized so each German state provides their own list. This simply reflects the
                    political system in Germany.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Surely it'd be nice if there was a central, free-of-charge repository containing all of Germany's school data such as school name, 
                    school address etc. in a single .csv, .json or .xlsx file. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I created such a single, free-of-charge file containing data on all schools in the 16 german states. 
                    It is MIT-licsensed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While creating it I learned about 
                    <a href="https://jedeschule.de/">
                        jedeschule.de
                    </a>
                    who nicely visualised a lot of school data and made their cleaned data 
                    <a href="https://jedeschule.de/daten/">
                        available    
                    </a>
                    for free. The issue being that some of their data is somewhat heterogenous (e.g. school adress sometimes
                    contains city name and sometimes it doesn't) as they provide a separate file for each german state. 
                    So their data would likely require further processing.
                </p>
