			<h2> On Ukraine and decentralization </h2>
			
			<div class="blog_text">
				
				<p> 
					The unimaginable has happened and we find ourselves in a reality, long thought to have been overcome.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Europe is under military attack and millions of civilians and soldiers are suffering, losing their homes,
					their families and their inalienable right of self-determination. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The right of self-determination has potentially been the single greatest archivement in the history of our species.
					Not just in a political sense but, perhaps even more importantly, on an individual level. People in free Europe
					largely have the ability to determine their individual fate and write their own story. War and oppression takes the 
					right of self-determination away from people.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Devoted your studies and career to medicine to help others? Your university and hospital was bombed.
							And if its rebuild after the war you have to work longer hours for a fraction of the salary.
						</li>
						<li>Thought of inventing a rewnewable product? Sorry bro our oligarchs don't like competition for their oil and gas products.</li>
						<li>Want to have more than one child? Sad to tell you, but the all-knowing party doesn't allow that.</li>
						<li>Wish to live in a democratic country? Nah mate, can't let that happen or my people will want that too so I better kill you.</li>
						<li>Have an opinion different from the regime's? Gotta make sure your messaging app stays unecrypted.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					War and oppression hold back the best human characteristic - <b>the ingenuity to create a better future</b>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					And by that I do not mean inventing consumer products. I am referring to the inner drive a lot of humans have to create things
					that manifest a better world. New medicines and therapeutics, mars roboters, space telescopes, building codes, renewable energy
					resources, renewable food tech, social, psychological and care services, information privacy services, ...
				</p>
				
				<p>
					These sort of inventions are often held back by the oppressors because they challenge the status quo - something inacceptable
					to them.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					In case of Ukraine, a megalomaniacal russian dictator wants to re-create the "glorious" greater russian empire so that russian school kids
					in the year 2084 still remember his "heroic" deeds and services. Great article on this: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/27/vladimir-putin-russia-ukraine-power">theguardian/sorokin</a>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Measures of oppression can be mapped to a wide spectrum. While the doings of Putin, Hitler, Mao and Stalin constitute one extrem,
					the free world struggles with measures of oppression as well, such as privacy infrigements. These are minor compared to the war Putin is waging against Ukraine. But no one can be certain they won't grow into larger measures of oppression in the future, as happened in Russia from the 
					late 90s until today.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					How can the people of earth protect themselves against the spiral of oppression and war that has been
					with us for thousands of years?
				</p>
				<p>
					One potential answer is to reach a concensus between every human/nation not to go to war with each or to oppress others.
					Following this concencus would be incentiviced, breaking it would instantly lead to a gigantic penality.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					I believe the above outlined mechanism can only work effectively under the following conditions:
					
					<ol>
						<li>
							If the mechanism is decetralized, i.e. no single entity (such as the UN), is in charge of controlling and enforcing it.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the mechanism has strong enough incentives and penalities. The mechanism should be linked to (or be) the financial and monetary system.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the mechanism completely replaces the political system of nation states in a democratic and decentralized manner.
						</li>
						<li>
							If the mechanism indeed leads to lasting peace and little-to-no oppression, then the human species should set itself
							a goal, potentially already part of the mechanism. 
							That goal can be: actually stopping climate change, helping the poorest 1 billion people out of poverty and/or space exploration.
							Indeed I believe space exploration will reinforce the rationale that a peaceful and oppression-free human civilization is to be archived
							because space exploration will alter our perspective on human fallibility.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<b>Smart law</b> should, and hopefully will, become a reality in the future. 
					The consequences of the alternative can be observed on TV these days <i>(28.02.2022)</i>.
