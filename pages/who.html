			<h2> Who speaks for earth? </h2>

			<p>
				And the world impoverished itself by spending a trillion dollars a year [2022: >$2 trillion]
				on preparations for war, and by employing perhaps half the scientists and high-technologists on the planet
				in military endeavours.
			</p>

			<p>
				How would we explain all this to a dispassionate, extraterrestrial observer?
			</p>

			<p>
				What account would we give of our stewardship of the planet earth?
			</p>

			<p>
				We have heard the rationales offered by the superpowers. We know who speaks for the nations.
			</p>

			<p>
				But who speaks for the human species, who speaks for earth?
			</p>
